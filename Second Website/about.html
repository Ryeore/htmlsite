			<h1>Why?</h1>
			<p> This system was created by students for students. <br>
			Also for reviewers and supervisors.</p>
			<p>Nowadays every student has to do everything by himself. Asking professors for supervision, suggesting the topic of thesis. <br>
				Also supervisors have a lot of work to do. Receiving emails, answering to students requests. It can generate a lot of chaos and disorganization. <br>
				The best answer for all of this problems is our system, which will help with the whole process.
				The user can find here all necessary things needed in dissertation process.<br>
				Students are able to :
				<ul>
					<li>choose the topic of their thesis from list of proposed topics</li>
					<li>upload thesis</li>
					<li>get feedback from supervisor</li>
					<li>check progress of grading etc.</li>
				</ul>
				Supervisor and reviewers are able to:
				<ul>
					<li>Check and grade the thesis</li>
					<li>Post some comments about thesis</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p> We decided to serve everything in the simplest form with easy to understand interface.</p>
