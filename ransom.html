			<h1>Ransomware: not every virus is as scary as it is painted</h1>

				<dt>List of ransomwares I'll write about:</dt>
				<dd>- PUBG Ransomware</dd>
				<dd>- Hitler Ransonware</dd>

			<p>Security researchers claim that encryption threats (Ransomware) are the most common causes of attacks on computers and mobile devices. The target of the attackers are not only ordinary users, but also companies and institutions, such as the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/04/23/atlanta-spends-over-2-million-ransomware-recovery/">city hall in Atlanta</a> or a <a href="https://www.cyberscoop.com/hancock-hospital-ransomware/">hospital in Indiana</a>.</p>
			
			<p>The first position on the list is taken by <b>PUBG Ransomware</b>. The name derives from the popular PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds. The software encrypts the files on the victim's desktop, and adds the <i>.PUBG</i> extension to them. So what is the way to decrypt the files? Just play the game for one hour.<br>
			However, there are also other ways to restore files. You can simply rewrite the code from the welcome screen, or run the <i>TslGame.exe</i> file for 3 seconds, despite the required one hour. People who did not realize how this program works, probably it would have caused a lot of fear. In 2017, a similar threat, called RensenWare, was created, which in order to decrypt the files, ordered the victim to get 200 million points at the Lunatic level in <i>Undefined Fantastic Object</i>.</p>

			<p>The next noteworthy malware is Hitler Ransomware. This software was discovered by AVG lab analyst - Jakub Kroustek. It is worth paying attention to the original spelling with an error,<br> <b>Hitler-Ranso<u>n</u>ware</b>. The program presents the figure of Adolf Hitler with the information, that in order to decrypt files victim should give the code for a 25 Euro Vodafone card.</p>

			<p>Another unusual threat is the <b>nRansom</b> program, which has been detected by researchers from MalwareHunterTeam. Usually the Bitcoins are used to pay for the decryption of files due to identity protection, however, in the case of nRansomware, the tender card is to send your naked photos. Most probably, the program was created by a teenager. You can tell from the look of the application, the name of the music files and the e-mail address on which you need to send photos.
			The music file is called <i>your-mom-gay.mp3</i>, and in fact it's the song Frolic, written by Luciano Michelini. This is a composition also known from the Curb Your Enthusiasm show. 10 photos need to be sent to the email <i>1_kill_yourself_1@protonmail.com</i> to get the code to decrypt files. The program does not fully work properly, because after entering the correct code and pressing the Unlock button, nothing happens. The way to close the program is to minimize it and end the process from the Task Manager.</p>
