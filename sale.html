        <p>In contrast to the promotion prepared by Sony, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/explore/games/playstation-hits/">PlayStation Hits</a>, which so far has not been limited in time, the sale on the Microsoft website lasted only until the end of July.
        Although the number of discounted games on PS4 is expected to increase over time, one can say that the Japanese company could now try a bit more.<br>
        <br>
        It is worth noting that the discounted games have been divided into two sections. The full list of games available for consoles is
        available <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/pl-pl/store/collections/UGS19.games/XBOX?icid=Cat-Sales-Hero2-FY19-UGS-Dual1">here</a>,
